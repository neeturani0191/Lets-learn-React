### **What is emmet ?**
1. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.
For Example : 
    1. boilerplate HTML code
    2. building hierarchical structures
    3. adding custom characteristics and class/ids

### **Difference between a Library and Framework?**
1.Libraries provide the user a lot of control and have a low barrier to entry. They may be effortlessly merged into existing applications to provide new functionality, and they normally need little expertise and boilerplate code to get started.

2.Frameworks are more powerful, but they dictate how users structure their code. They are more likely to be utilised when starting a new project rather than being absorbed into an existing codebase, and the developer will need to learn about the framework's key principles before they can begin using it successfully. However, this inversion of control also aids developers in avoiding typical mistakes, inefficiencies, and bikeshedding.
Overall, Frameworks are more opinionated, whereas libraries are more adaptable. Both abstraction patterns have a place in the world of programming, and while none is necessarily superior, it's important to determine which is best for the scenario at hand.

**_Analogy_** : -

A library is like going to Amazon Furniture. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You don’t feel like making your own table from scratch.  Amazon Furniture allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.

A framework, on the other hand, is similar to constructing a model home. You have a set of blueprints and just a few restricted options for architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

**jQuery, React** => Libraries 
**Angular, Vue** => Framework

### **What is CDN? Why do we use it?**
a content delivery network (CDN) : It is a global server network that caches and sends information through the nearest edge server rather than the origin server, thereby lowering page load time.

So whatever type of content you’re consuming online, a CDN has probably been used to ensure it loads quickly for you. Many websites and online services rely on CDNs as a cost-effective way to improve uptime and perform.

Why is a CDN important :
CDN’s basically store a replicated, or cached, version of website content in multiple points of presence (PoPs) all around the world, so that users can access it from the PoP that is located within the closest proximity to them. So if you’re trying to access content in Cyprus, let’s say, you won’t have to wait for it to travel from a server based in Los Angeles.

#### Benefits : 
1. Performance: High performance and speed
2. Security: provides extra peace of mind
3. SEO: making your website more visible and higher ranking 
4. Availability: your content to be readily available all time by using the cached content. 

A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as _Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks_.

By including CDN Links for REACT and REACT_DOM, we get access to REACT GLOBAL VARIABLE

REACT-DOM : specific for web

### **Why is React known as React?**
If rule No.1 in software development is simplicity and avoiding complexity at all costs, then React JS DEAD simple!

One of the top benefits of React is how easy it is to grasp, particularly if you already are a pro at JavaScript. You can install React and be up and running in a few hours, getting straight to work building web applications. 

React JS makes front-end development a piece of cake for developers. It allows developers to declaratively describe user interfaces, taking a lot of the heavy lifting out of the coding process while making the code more simple to read and understand. It makes interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and updating the DOM virtually.
You can rely on the React library to get the job done.
On top of that, React JS has (at the time of writing) 218009 packages available on NPM, a subsidiary of GitHub.

Reusable Components: A stand-out benefit of React is its ability to reuse code throughout an application. It’s the React ‘get out of jail free card’ as you escape being a prisoner to hours of tedious and repetitive coding tasks. Hence- React helps you work smarter, not harder.

React renders the DOM (Document Object Model) virtually first as a copy of the actual DOM. React will only make the changes necessary changes to the UIs through the virtual DOM. Consequently, an application doesn’t have to re-render the entire User Interface and speeds up loading times. 
This has a massive impact on SEO

React is Easy to Scale: First, React apps happily scale to hundreds or even thousands of components, without breaking a sweat.
Second, React is built to be extremely versatile to easily integrate with other third-party libraries and frameworks in your tech stack.

### **What is crossorigin in script tag?**

The crossorigin attribute changes the mode of the request to HTTP CORS Request.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource from another domain (for example, style sheets, iframes, pictures, fonts, or scripts).
CORS is a protocol for managing cross-origin requests.
CORS, which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a method that allows resources on a web page to be requested from a domain other than their own. It specifies how a browser and server might communicate to decide if it is safe to authorise a cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to determine who can access the server's assets, among other things.

### **What is diference between React and ReactDOM**

React => a global variable used to construct UI, such as 'React.createElement()'

ReactDOM => is used to render components in the browser by injecting them into the root of the DOM, `root.render()`

### **What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?**

react.development.js => only for development purposes not suitable for production

react.production.js => React production versions that have been minified and optimised

### **What is async and defer? - 

**To return a promise, we utilise async.
To wait and manage a promise, we utilise await.
